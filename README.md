# pomodoro
A very bare bones pomodoro app which you can use to keep track of how much work you do.

## Getting Started
You can just compile the codebase and run it onto your own device if you like.
I wanted to try creating this to learn flutter,
and this is also my first actual app outside of tutorials.

Since this is my first app in flutter I have no idea if the code is structured properly or not.
I also know not about the "correct" way of doing things in the flutter way.

You can comb through the code if you like, though.
